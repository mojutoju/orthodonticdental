<strong> CURAPROX </strong> stands for knowledge, and the transfer of skills to ensure perfect oral care and oral health. Since 1972.

We teach more than just the importance of white teeth and fresh breath. Oral health is essential to healthy organs and a healthy body.

That’s why CURAPROX develops motivation- and training programs for dental professionals. Each year, we train and certify thousands of iTOP/CURAPROX oral hygiene instructors worldwide. They help patients get motivated and acquire the skills they need to keep their mouths, teeth and gums in perfect condition. It’s all about the long term.

Our methods work because the patient feels the difference. With CURAPROX, brushing your teeth is fun – because it’s so easy and because the positive results are so clear to see.

In this sense, our products are “only” the means to an end. They also always help maintain the motivation for thorough cleaning. That’s why we always work hard and tirelessly on making our products the most attractive, coveted and best in the world – winning over a million new CURAPROX fans each year.

They don’t call us «the Swiss teeth obsessives» for no reason.

<strong> AlignIT </strong> is Nigerian made custom clear aligners are used to correct misaligned teeth. They are classified as an orthodontic treatment that helps to straighten teeth without the use of the typical metal braces.

AlignIT uses CA® CLEAR-ALIGNER Technology.

AlignIT uses the CA® CLEAR-ALIGNER system which has been in use for more than 10 years successfully to helping patients get an easy and beautiful smiles. The process includes a scan with a digital scanner that ensures a complete, accurate scan of your teeth in minutes, without all the mess and inconsistencies of at-home dental impression kits.
Following an initial scan and assessment of your jaw and teeth, a set of clear aligners will be made to your specific needs. These aligners are made from the finest of materials and they are just as flexible and durable.
After they’ve been made, the aligners are sent to your home in your own Impressions kit, which also includes complimentary whitening gel. Aligners are changed out weekly to slowly move teeth into alignment.
If you have wondered whether you qualified for a cosmetic procedure, then you should take this assessment quiz.
